Tired of keyboards being called "XT" when all they have is two macro columns on the left? Wishing for an authentic XT Layout experience? Look no further!

## Design changes after prototype

* Changed weight screws from M4 to M3
* Increased clearance around daughterboard
* Changed PCB compatibility to support keycaps from NCR G80-0577

| M3x0.5x4mm Button Head Cap Screw | 2  | https://www.mcmaster.com/92095A471 |
| 10cm Molex to JST Cable | 1 | https://cannonkeys.com/products/unified-daughterboard-and-jst-cable |
| M3x0.5x5mm Countersunk Screw | 5 | https://www.mcmaster.com/91294A125 |

The 8mm M2 screws are for the case and the 5mm M2 screws are for the PCB. You can probably getting away with 6mm M2 screws for both.
